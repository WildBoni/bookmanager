# Book Manager (BKMNGR) - UNDER DEVELOPMENT

Book Manager is an open-source online database where you can store your books.

  - MySql database
  - PHP pages
  - Bootstrap layout
  - AJAX techniques

## Features

These are the main features (please note that BKMNGR is still under development):

* Responsive layout: access your library database from mobile
* Edit/Update your library
* Advanced search filters
* Keep track of books you lend
* Login / Subscribe with different accounts (and different libraries)
* Auto-create MySql database structure through php install page
* AJAX implementation for infinite scrolling, autocomplete suggestions, and more!

## Installation

* First of all, make sure you have mysql and php installed on your server!
* Download the whole package, unzip it and upload it to your server
* Run install.php and compile the form with mysql database connection
* Log in and start creating your library!

After the first installation, remember to delete install.php and create.php!

## Other cool ideas

These features may be implemented later on...

* ISBN integration for instant book registration through barcorde scan
* Mobile app
